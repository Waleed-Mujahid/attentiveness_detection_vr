# Attentiveness Detection in a Metaverse Classroom

## Description

In this repo, we have preprocessed the data which is generated by the [CPT Test](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563216300759) in a metaverse environment and then we have implemented different ML algorithms in order to measure the attention of a student in a metaverse classroom.

Here are the files description in the repo:

- parse.ipynb (Notebook preprocessed the raw data and implements different ML alogrithms)
- time frame analysis directory (Caught the time dependency of the data)
- time frame variation (Analyse the change of time frame on the prediction)
- lstms (Implementation and data of LSTMs and a try to run arima)

So, far we are not having the results of our expectation especially in the LSTMs and we are planning to integrate it with the product analyse its shortcomings and plan to improve its performance by tuning it.
